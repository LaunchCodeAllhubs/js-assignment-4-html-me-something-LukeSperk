         <h1>My Favorite Two Player Games</h1>

         <h2>Intro</h2>

         <p>Hello! On this page I am going to talk about some of my personal favorite two player board games. Two player games can often be competitive, head-to-head battles of wit, which is what my personal taste leans towards. All games I talk about will be strictly for two players. There are some games for larger player counts that also play great with just two, but I will not be detailing those here. The games will be subjectively ordered by their rule complexity, from simplest to learn to most complex.  I have included an image of each game as well as a link to their BoardGameGeek.com page. </p>

               <h2>Onitama</h2>
               <p>In the chess-like Onitama, you win in one of two ways. You can capture your opponent's master, a special piece similar to the king in chess, or you can move your master safely across the board to the other temple, the space where your opponent's master started. Unlike chess, the master and student pieces do not have defined movement types. The two cards in front of you define the movement options for all your pieces. After using a card's movement option, you set it between yourself and your opponent and then replace it with the card your opponent played last turn. In this way, the 5 cards in play cycle between players and create a tense, tactical game flow. The cards stay face up so you always know what options your opponent has for their next turn. This creates interesting decisions each turn, but not so many options that players get stuck in analysis paralysis. The base game comes with 16 movement cards, of which you randomly choose 5 for each match. The variablity of this set up keeps each game feeling fresh and unique. If you like the base game there are some excellent expansions available which add more cards and new mechanics.</p>

               <h2>Great Plains</h2>
               <p>Great Plains is quick game of territory control with a variable set up which sees a team of snakes facing off against a team of foxes. To create the board, you shuffle around the seven 2-sided hexagonal tiles randomly and form a flower shape. The goal is to have majority control of the chunks of yellow spaces by placing your animals inside them. Each turn you will simply place one of your animals next to one of your caves or another one of your placed animals. The green spaces don't award points but instead give you one of the 3 types of power-ups. The power ups can be spent to place an animal one space further away, on the other side of a mountain space, or in the space your opponent's animal is currently holding. The game feels like a tactical race to both claim space for yourself and block your opponent from expanding into your territory. The variable set up makes it very replayable and the quick pace often leads to immediate rematches or best of three series.  </p>

               <h2>Hive</h2>
               <p>Hive is my desert island game, that is, the game I would pick if I was stranded  on a desert island and could only have one board game. I have played it upwards of 75 times and I still feel like I am learning more about its strategies every time I play. Hive is another chess like game but it ditches the board to be played like dominoes on the table. The goal is to surround your opponent's queen bee on all sides. Each turn you choose between adding a bug of your color to the hive or moving one of your bugs that's already on the hive. Each type of bug moves in a unique way that evokes the movent of the real life bug. The grasshopper can jump over pieces in a straight line, for instance. The hive is the clump of all the bug pieces in play. The hive cannot be broken in two, so if a bug is bridging two parts of the hive, it is unable to move. Wrapping your head around this restriction and using it to your advantage is one of the keys to success in Hive. I reccomend the pocket version of the game because it comes with a travel pouch that fits easily in a backpack or purse, and it includes a couple extra bug types that were not in the original version.</p>

               <h2>Mandala</h2>
               <p>Unlike other games, on this list, I do not have a clear point of comparison for Mandala, because there's no other game like it that I've played. You are competing with your opponent to control two zones, or mandalas, simulataneously. Each turn you will add cards from your hand onto on of the mandalas. The mandalas are broken into 3 sections, your field, the mountain, and your opponents field. Cards come in six colors and each color can only be in one section of a mandala, which restricts your options for placing. Once a mandala has all six colors, it gets scored and reset. The middle section, the mountain, is the reward for having more total cards in your field. If this seems abstract and complicated, that's because it is! But once you wrap your head around it, it is a perplexing and tickling puzzle to try to crack. The layers of strategy evolve as you learn how to navigate the game's mechanics. The game is played on a piece of canvas and the artwork is beautiful kaleidoscope tapestries, which all together looks gorgeous and mysterious on the table.</p>

               <h2>Air, Land, & Sea</h2>
               <p>I am not often a fan of classic military theming for games, but the core gameplay of Air, Land, & Sea is so good that it transcends its admittedly stale theme. You are rival generals in a war that will take places over multiple battles, with each battle played out in the three titular theatres of war. Within a battle, you will play cards onto the three theatres, trying to control at least two of them by the end to win the battle. You control theatres by having the most total power on your side. Each card has a power value and many of the cards have additonal effects that let you influence the game when you play it. Cards belong to one of the theates where it must be played if played face up, but cards can also be played face down in any theatre for 2 power. Many of the card effects let you get around these restrictions or flip other cards over to the other side. There are only eightteen cards in the game (1-6 in each theatre color) so learning the card effects and interactions doesn't take long. The juicy twist on the battles is that you can withdraw from a battle early to award your opponent fewer points for winning. So if your opponent comes out strong early, you can cut your loses and go on to the next one. Alternatively, if you can trick your opponent into thinking they have a battle under control early, then flip things in your favor later on, you will get a larger reward. The game evokes the tactical feelings of a card game like Magic the Gathering but a much more limited card pool, and all the cards are included in the relatively cheap base game box.</p>

               <h2>Splendor Duel</h2>
               <p>Splendor is a modern classic in the tabletop hobby, and for good reason. Splendor Duel adapts Splendor for just two players and makes it a little more competitive and toothy. You have ample opportunities to deny your opponent the resources they need or the cards they want to buy and you can even steal from them occasionally. If you haven't played Splendor, the game is about gathering gem resources and artisans to produce beautiful jewelery and adornments to ultimately curry the favor of nobles and obtain prestige. You spend gem tokens to buy artisan cards, and each card you have counts as a gem towards the cost of the next cards you buy. As you get more cards, the game ramps up because you can afford the more expensive cards which carry juicier rewards. This is my favorite way to play Splendor currently, because the head-to-head elements create a tense and tricky path to victory. </p>
